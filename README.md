Characterize the final user: who will be the final user? What is he/she expected to find in your project?

The final Users will be the HR sources who select candidates to enter their company. In this website they will find all my information to contact me and all the studies and experience i have to fulfil the job. I also included some useful info about me as a person so they can see if i am the right person for the job.

Information architecture: In this website i just have a page but i have structured by id so with the Nab var you can go exactly where you need. And i also used bootstrap so the web is resizeable, to accomplish this i've used a bootstrap grid. i have also use React in this project so it's simpler to in prove it as i've made every part of it a component so if in the future i want to improve it all i have to do is to implement other components and not remake it.

Visual Desing: For visuals i went to the black and white that always works. To give it a touch, i've used deferents SVG to make it less boring in the contact part. The web is a 2x3 grid to emphasize the relevant part, and i also make it asymmetrical to seem more elegant. For inspiration i have used my own CV which i made some years ago to seek job, i think this Desing is sober and clear with the info i want to transmit.
