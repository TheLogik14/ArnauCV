Characterize the final user: who will be the final user? What is he/she
expected to find in your project?

The final Users will be the HR sources how select candidates to enter their company. In this webside they will find all my information to contact me and all the studies and expirience i have to fulfill the job. I also included some usful info about me as a person so they can see if i am the right person for the job.

Information architecture: In this websidw i just have a page but i have structured by id so with the navbar you can go exacly where you need. And i also used bootstrap so the web is resizable, to acpolish this i've used a bootstrap grid. i have also use react in this project so it's simpler to in prove it as i've made every part of it a component so if in the future i want to inprove it all i have to do is to implement other components and not remake it.

Visual desing: For visuals i went to the black and white that allways works. To give it a touch i've used diferents svg to make it less boring in the contact part. The web is a 2x3 grid to emphasize the relevat part and i also make it asymetrical to seem more elegant. For inspiration i have used my own CV which i made some years ago to seek job, i think this desing is sober and clear with the info i want to transmit.
